Hello! ðŸš¨ **You probably don't need this anymore** ðŸš¨ as it was originally authored back in 2017. [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) has supported generating a minimum bundle graph _for a while now_.

The README is left below for posterity.

# srcgraph

srcgraph code splits ES6 modules.
It accepts multiple JS module entrypoints, and returns the minimum number of modules required to represent the source graph.
If you want to know more, see [my talk from Polymer Summit 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIP4pjAqCtQ&feature=youtu.be&t=27m35s) (links to the discussion of srcgraph).

srcgraph includes a Gulp plugin which generates said modules.
It can also be run to generate loosely-coupled script tags that do not use `import` and `export.`

## Example

<img src="example.png" align="center" />

On the left, we have an abstract dependency graph.
Imagine that `entry1.js` looks likeâ€”

```js
// entry1.js
import './A.js';
```

and `A.js` imports C, and D etc.

The right side is the output of srcgraph.

### Process

srcgraph walks the dependency graph, marking each node with the entry points that use it.
Nodes that are used by only one entry point are merged into their module.

However, the remaining nodes (D, E and F) can't be naÃ¯vely bundled into a big bag.
Because D and E have unique ways in which they are used, we turn them into individual modules so that the entry points of D and E are still exposed.
Conceptaully we've just made the D and E modules 'bigger' (well, D remains the same size).
They still export the same entry points.

### Notes

If we performed symbol renaming (i.e. so that `entry1.js` can safely import D and E, because the names 'could not collide'), it'd be possible to merge the two D and E modules together.
This is, however, a simple approach that scales to any number of entry points.

## Usage

### Graph

To determine the minimum number of modules needed for a complex dependency graph, include and use `graph.js`.
(You can check out the code and run this yourself!)

```js
const graph = require('./graph.js');
graph(['demo/src/entry1.js', 'demo/src/entry2.js']).then((modules) => {
  modules.forEach((module) => {
    console.info(module);
  });
  // modules contains an array of:
  // Module{id: './test/entry1.js', srcs: ['./test/entry1.js', './test/A.js', './test/C.js']}
  // Module{id: './test/D.js', srcs: ['./test/D.js']}
  // .. and so on
});
```

These modules can be used as arguments to [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
Generate a matching number of modules that include only those src files, and assume all other dependencies are external.

### Gulp Plugin

The Gulp plugin, provided in `plugin.js` (or as `require('srcgraph').gulp`, if you're using this via a package manager), invokes the graph algorithm as well as running Rollup.

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const srcgraph = require('srcgraph').gulp;

gulp.task('rollup', function() {
  const options = {};
  return gulp.src(['path/to/your/entrypoints/*.js'])
    .pipe(srcgraph(options))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));
});
```

This will write out the minimum number of modules needed inside `dist`.

If you specify the format as IIFE, then the same file will be generated, but they will simply create global `var` objects.
You'll be responsible for including the files in the right order (unlike ES6 modules, which have import/export statements), but you'll see the same split.

```js
  const options = {format: 'iife'};
  return gulp.src(['path/to/your/entrypoints/*.js'])
    .pipe(srcgraph(options))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist'));  // generates code without import and export
```

## Caveats

If your ES6 module code relies on the ordering of import statements to run code, then srcgraph may not be for you.
For example:

```js
import './code-that-effects-window.js';    // makes window.blah
import './code-that-uses-that-effect.js';  // calls window.blah()
```

If the first dependency is bundled but the second is not, then the second dependency will fail to runâ€”`import` is hoisted, and always runs before other code.
The output would look like:

```js
window.blah = function() {
  // very important function
};
import './code-that-uses-that-effect.js';  // calls window.blah(), but runs before any normal code
```

This is fairly uncommon, and the example is contrived, but effects all approaches to split bundling for ES6 modules.
